## Getting to know Darice
**First thing before starting to modify the ccs of the closed captions, we got the chance to get to know Darice a little bit and know more about what she would expect / wants to see.**

### Things Darice mentioned in regards to the styling of the closed captions
- She likes minimalism.
- One thing that she likes about films is the feeling she can get from them. (Like Nostalgia when watching old films.)
- Not a fan of too much movement of the video, it's not supposed to take away from the film itself.
- The thing she thinks is missing the most when it comes to subtitles is the lack of subtitles for the sounds.
- When different people are talking, use another color for the subtitles.
- Use different font styling. Examples: Bold for screaming. Italic for whispering.

## First css changes
**The first thing I did was go over the top, to be able to really see what darice dislikes.**
- I made the video big and put the text on top of the video.
Darice mentioned that its good if the subtitles are in the middle of the video at the bottom. They she doesnt have to look side to side. As it is 
- I made the different speakers get a different color when they spoke. The questioner; yellow, Contant K; white and the random man; orange.
- The first few sounds repeat themselves 3 times. The sound to me felt like some kind of computerized object opening and closing so I wanted to alternate between black and another color. I chose green, red and blue. 
- Theres also a frantic beeping sound which I wanted to style by having the background color flicker between red and black repeatedly.

## Feedback 1
- Color changes for different speakers is effective but I should think about the typography aswell.
- Green red and blue don't really say anything
- Frantic beeping works well and is well timed
- Frantic beeping works well and is well timed

## Second ccs changes
**With my team we decided to each test a specific thing in our video so that we can get as much insight as possible as to what Darice would like and what she wouldn't like. We tested text placement, background colors and movement, movement when it comes to the video itself and sound closed captions /  discriptions.**
- I added discriptions for the sounds. I made them bright blue to be a different from the closed captions of the people that speak.
- I decided to change the first few sounds (that I initially made green red and blue.) A light cream greentone (#B7BFAE) So now the sounds go from that color to black.
- I made Costant K Brenner `font-family: "Brenner Sans Medium";` because He's supposed to be the human one.
- The questioner, out of sight and his voice comes from speakers of some kind of computer `font-family: "Brenner Mono Light";`
- The random man, also human, but whispering    `font-family: "Brenner Sans Light Italic";`
- The sounds `font-family: "Brenner Mono Light Italic"; `because they all sound a bit computerized.

## Feedback Darice
**Darice really liked my video especially because I had the sounds as closed captions.
She did tell me to make sure my contrast on the sounds' closed captions is a little higher to be more visible. **

## Last changes
- I made the sounds' closed captions dark red instead.
- Lastly I made my blinking animation go from dark red to to bright red, so it can seem like its gets more intense as the baseline test goes on.


### Principles

**The 4 principles:**
I think I did pretty well when it comes to the 4 principles.

**Study the situation**
We got to know darice, asked her questions about her likes and dislikes. Got feedback from her and listened to her tips.
We studied her situaion in specific and what she feels like she misses when watching a movie.

**Ignore Conventions**
Subtitles are usually white boring standard font. By doing this asignment and catering to Darice we already ignored most conventions when it comes to subtitles. background changing colors, different fonts for different people speaking etc.

**Prioritize identity**
Since this assignment wasn't one with a targeted group rather just one targeted person. we had to make something Darice was happy with. while also still making it something that we were happy with. Darice said when we got to know her that her things are always minimal. 

The baseline test itself has like a mysterious aura. If you watch the video on it's own you actually wouldn't really know what was going on. I wanted the sounds to really be made clear with my css styling.

**Add nonsense**
I added a blinking background when the sound is rapidly beeping. Is it needed? no. But it makes the sound more obvious and gives you the abbility to feel the sound with just visuals.
