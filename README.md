# Web Typography, 2020/2021

## Getting to know Darice
First thing before starting to modify the ccs of the closed captions, we got the chance to get to know Darice a little bit and know more about what she would expect / wants to see.

### Things Darice mentioned in regards to the styling of the closed captions
- She likes minimalism.
- One thing that she likes about films is the feeling she can get from them. (Like Nostalgia when watching old films.)
- Not a fan of too much movement of the video, it's not supposed to take away from the film itself.
- The thing she thinks is missing the most when it comes to subtitles is the lack of subtitles for the sounds.
- When different people are talking, use another color for the subtitles.
- Use different font styling. Examples: Bold for screaming. Italic for whispering.

## First css changes
The first thing I did was go over the top, to be able to really see what darice dislikes.
- I made the video big and put the text on top of the video
- I made the different speakers get a different color when they spoke. The questione; yellow, Contant K; white, the random man; orange.
- The first few sounds repeat themselves 3 times. I got the feeling of something opening and closing so I wanted to alternate between black and another color. I chose green, red and blue. 
- Theres also a frantic beeping sound which I wanted to style by having the background color flicker between red and black repeatedly.

## Feedback
- Color changes for different speakers is effective but I should think about the typography aswell.
- Green red and blue don't really say anything
- Frantic beeping works well and is well timed

## Second ccs changes
- I added discriptions for the sounds like Darice suggested she would like. I made them bright blue to be a different from the closed captions of the people that speak.
- I decided to change the first few sounds (that I initially made green red and blue.) A greyish greentone. So now the sounds go from that color to black.
- I made Costant K Brenner `font-family: "Brenner Sans Medium";` because He's supposed to be the human one.
- The questioner, out of sight and his voice comes from speakers of some kind of computer `font-family: "Brenner Mono Light";`
- The random man, also human, but whispering    `font-family: "Brenner Sans Light Italic";`
- The sounds `font-family: "Brenner Mono Light Italic"`because they all sound a bit computerized.

## Feedback Darice
Darice really liked my video especially because I had the sounds as closed captions.
She did tell me to make sure my contrast on the sounds' closed captions is a little higher to be more visible.

## Last changes
- I made the sounds' closed captions dark red instead.
